# My old website
### About

Here's my old site, now abandoned because of the site builder tool. This was the first site I built, used it for a couple months, and finally didn't update it because the tool looked like it hadn't been updated in some time. The [tool](https://github.com/getgridea/gridea) is great for building static web pages visually and is perfect for newbies to get started.

Time to head over to the new site [here](https://github.com/iwenyi/iwenyi.github.io).
